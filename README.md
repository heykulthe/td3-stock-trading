# TD3-Based Stock Trading Agent
This project implements a Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) agent to simulate and optimize trading strategies in a custom-built financial market environment.

NOTE: The project is still a work in progress.

## Overview
The agent learns to make buy/sell/hold decisions based on historical stock price data. The training loop involves:

- Preprocessing data and constructing a trading environment
- Training a TD3 agent using a replay buffer
- Evaluating policy on a validation set based on the defined trading metrics
- Saving the best model for final testing

## Data fetch & preprocess
We use OANDA for fetching stock data with granularity ranging (30 seconds to 5 minutes). Based on OHLCV, we calculate technical indicators such as RSI, MACD, Log Returns, etc.

## Environment
The trading environment is defined with the following parameters:

| Parameter           | Value                    | Description                                                                 |

| `max_timesteps`     | 1.5 × len(train_df)      | Maximum timesteps per episode                                              |
| `batch_size`        | 512                      | Size of mini-batch for training                                            |
| `discount`          | 0.995                    | Discount factor (γ) for future rewards                                     |
| `tau`               | 0.0005                   | Soft update parameter for target networks                                  |
| `policy_noise`      | 0.15                     | Standard deviation of noise added to target policy during critic update    |
| `noise_clip`        | 0.35                     | Maximum allowed noise during target policy smoothing                       |
| `policy_freq`       | 2                        | Frequency of policy (actor) updates relative to critic updates             |
| `exploration_noise` | 0.2                      | Noise added to actions for exploration during training                     |
| `eval_freq`         | 2                        | Frequency (in episodes) of model evaluation                                |

The agent's action can range from (-1, 1) where -1 means sell all, 0 means to hold, and 1 means to buy maximum amount possible.

## Evaluation
The agent is evaluated using the following metrics:

- Sharpe Ratio: Risk-adjusted return
- Max Drawdown: Largest observed loss from a peak
- Standard Deviation of Returns
- Portfolio Value over time
